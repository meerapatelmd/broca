R Package of helpers for reading and writing dataframes and text. Functions that have simplified reading and writing tabular files, such as reading all fields as text data types to prevent parsing failures that often occur on read. Temporary tabular files can also be written by a single function call. By extension, "viewing" (`view_*`) functions allow the user to write tabular data to temporary files and opening in Excel directly from the console. Conversion functions document files between docx, GitHub-flavored Markdown, Markdown, and RMarkdown and tabular data files from Excel to csv.
