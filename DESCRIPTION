Description: Functions that have simplified reading and
    writing tabular files, such as reading all fields as text data types
    to prevent parsing failures that often occur on read. Temporary
    tabular files can also be written by a single function call. By
    extension, viewing functions allow the user to write tabular data to
    temporary files and opening in Excel directly from the console. Conversion 
    functions document files between docx, GitHub-flavored Markdown, Markdown, 
    and RMarkdown and tabular data files from Excel to csv.
